# # Hackerrank problem - 2

Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.

Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your variables.

Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:

Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.

Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers.

The second line contains two floating point numbers.

## Constraints 

1 ≤ integer variables ≤ 104

1 ≤ float variables ≤ 104

## Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

Sample Input 

10 4

4.0 2.0

Sample Output 

14 6

6.0 2.0

Explanation

When we sum the integers 10 and 4, we get the integer 14. When we subtract the second number 4 from the first number 10, we get 6 as their difference.

When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 2.0, we get 6.0. When we subtract the second number 2.0 from the first number 4.0, we get 2.0 as their difference.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int int1, int2;
    float float1, float2;
    scanf("%d %d", &int1, &int2);
    scanf("%f %f", &float1, &float2);
    printf("%d %d\n", int1 + int2, int1 - int2);
    printf("%.1f %.1f\n", float1 + float2, float1 - float2);
    return 0;
}
output:
15 5
6.3 2.1
